An evidence-based clinical decision support tool for acute ischaemic stroke management, incorporating the latest guidelines for IV thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy decisions.

## TIME IS BRAIN

**Every minute counts!** Rapid assessment and treatment are essential for optimal outcomes in acute ischemic stroke.

## Live Demo

Access the tool here: [https://dcicantab5.github.io/strokethrombolysis/](https://dcicantab5.github.io/strokethrombolysis/)

## Overview

This interactive web application guides healthcare providers through the critical decision-making process for acute ischaemic stroke treatment, based on:
- 2019 AHA/ASA Guidelines for Early Management of Acute Ischaemic Stroke
- Recent trials including DAWN, DEFUSE 3, ANGEL-ASPECT, and SELECT2
- Current best practices for extended window therapies

## Clinical Workflow

### Initial Assessment Requirements

1. **Clinical Evaluation**
   - Establish high probability of acute ischemic stroke
   - Sudden focal neurological deficits

2. **Confirm LKW (Last Known Well)**
   - Determine exact time patient was last in baseline state
   - Critical for treatment window determination

3. **Assess Severity**
   - NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale)
   - Score 0-42 (higher = more severe)
   - â‰¥6 indicates disabling stroke

4. **Neuroimaging**
   - NCCT to exclude intracerebral hemorrhage
   - CTA/MRA to identify vessel occlusion
   - Calculate ASPECTS score

5. **Laboratory**
   - Blood glucose (exclude hypoglycemia)
   - Coagulation studies if indicated

## Primary Treatment Options

### IV Thrombolysis (0-4.5 hours)
- **Medications**: Alteplase or Tenecteplase
- **Dosing**: 
  - Alteplase: 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg), 10% bolus, 90% over 60 min
  - Tenecteplase: 0.25 mg/kg bolus (max 25 mg)
- **Benefits**: Time-dependent (best within 90 minutes)
- **Risk**: Symptomatic ICH ~3.4%
- **BP Management**: <185/110 during, <180/105 for 24h after

### Mechanical Thrombectomy (0-24 hours*)
- **Indications**: Large vessel occlusion (LVO)
- **Time Windows**:
  - 0-6 hours: ASPECTS â‰¥6, standard eligibility
  - 6-24 hours: Requires perfusion imaging (DAWN/DEFUSE 3 criteria)
  - Large core (ASPECTS 3-5): Up to 24 hours with recent evidence
- **Locations**: ICA, M1, M2, or basilar artery
- **Notes**: Can combine with IV thrombolysis ("bridging therapy")

*Basilar occlusion: up to 24 hours with PC-ASPECTS â‰¥6

## Major Contraindications to IV Thrombolysis

- Active bleeding or recent major surgery
- Recent use of DOACs (within 48h)
- Severe uncontrolled hypertension (>185/110 mmHg)
- Platelet count <100,000/mmÂ³
- INR >1.7 or PT >15 seconds
- Blood glucose <50 mg/dL
- Previous stroke within 3 months
- Head trauma within 3 months
- GI/GU hemorrhage within 21 days
- Major surgery within 14 days

## Alternative Treatments

### Not Eligible for Thrombolysis/Thrombectomy?

**Minor Strokes (NIHSS â‰¤5)**
- Dual antiplatelet therapy within 24-72 hours
- Clopidogrel 300-600mg + Aspirin 81-325mg
- Continue for 21-90 days, then single antiplatelet

**All Other Patients**
- Aspirin 160-300mg within 48 hours
- Continue for secondary prevention

## Decision Algorithm Features

The web application includes:
- **Step-by-step assessment** workflow
- **Automatic time window calculations**
- **Real-time eligibility determination**
- **Evidence-based recommendations**
- **Post-treatment management guidance**

## Post-Treatment Management

- Monitor neurological status closely
- Maintain appropriate BP targets
- Hold antithrombotics for 24h after thrombolysis
- Admit to stroke unit or neuro ICU
- Initiate secondary prevention measures
